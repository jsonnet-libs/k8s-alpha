## Fields

### fn withFieldPath

```ts
withFieldPath(fieldPath)
```

If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2]. For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of an object.

### fn withKind

```ts
withKind(kind)
```

Kind of the referent. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

### fn withName

```ts
withName(name)
```

Name of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names

### fn withNamespace

```ts
withNamespace(namespace)
```

Namespace of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/

### fn withResourceVersion

```ts
withResourceVersion(resourceVersion)
```

Specific resourceVersion to which this reference is made, if any. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency

### fn withUid

```ts
withUid(uid)
```

UID of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#uids
