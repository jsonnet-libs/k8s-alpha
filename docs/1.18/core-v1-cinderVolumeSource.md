## Fields

### fn withFsType

```ts
withFsType(fsType)
```

Filesystem type to mount. Must be a filesystem type supported by the host operating system. Examples: "ext4", "xfs", "ntfs". Implicitly inferred to be "ext4" if unspecified. More info: https://examples.k8s.io/mysql-cinder-pd/README.md

### fn withReadOnly

```ts
withReadOnly(readOnly)
```

Optional: Defaults to false (read/write). ReadOnly here will force the ReadOnly setting in VolumeMounts. More info: https://examples.k8s.io/mysql-cinder-pd/README.md

### fn withVolumeID

```ts
withVolumeID(volumeID)
```

volume id used to identify the volume in cinder. More info: https://examples.k8s.io/mysql-cinder-pd/README.md

## obj secretRef

LocalObjectReference contains enough information to let you locate the referenced object inside the same namespace.

### fn secretRef.withName

```ts
withName(name)
```

Name of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names
