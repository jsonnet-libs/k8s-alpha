## Fields

## obj exec

ExecAction describes a "run in container" action.

### fn exec.withCommand

```ts
withCommand(command)
```

Command is the command line to execute inside the container, the working directory for the command  is root ('/') in the container's filesystem. The command is simply exec'd, it is not run inside a shell, so traditional shell instructions ('|', etc) won't work. To use a shell, you need to explicitly call out to that shell. Exit status of 0 is treated as live/healthy and non-zero is unhealthy.

### fn exec.withCommandMixin

```ts
withCommandMixin(command)
```

Command is the command line to execute inside the container, the working directory for the command  is root ('/') in the container's filesystem. The command is simply exec'd, it is not run inside a shell, so traditional shell instructions ('|', etc) won't work. To use a shell, you need to explicitly call out to that shell. Exit status of 0 is treated as live/healthy and non-zero is unhealthy.

**Note:** This function appends passed data to existing values

## obj httpGet

HTTPGetAction describes an action based on HTTP Get requests.

### fn httpGet.withHost

```ts
withHost(host)
```

Host name to connect to, defaults to the pod IP. You probably want to set "Host" in httpHeaders instead.

### fn httpGet.withHttpHeaders

```ts
withHttpHeaders(httpHeaders)
```

Custom headers to set in the request. HTTP allows repeated headers.

### fn httpGet.withHttpHeadersMixin

```ts
withHttpHeadersMixin(httpHeaders)
```

Custom headers to set in the request. HTTP allows repeated headers.

**Note:** This function appends passed data to existing values

### fn httpGet.withPath

```ts
withPath(path)
```

Path to access on the HTTP server.

### fn httpGet.withPort

```ts
withPort(port)
```

IntOrString is a type that can hold an int32 or a string.  When used in JSON or YAML marshalling and unmarshalling, it produces or consumes the inner type.  This allows you to have, for example, a JSON field that can accept a name or number.

### fn httpGet.withScheme

```ts
withScheme(scheme)
```

Scheme to use for connecting to the host. Defaults to HTTP.

## obj tcpSocket

TCPSocketAction describes an action based on opening a socket

### fn tcpSocket.withHost

```ts
withHost(host)
```

Optional: Host name to connect to, defaults to the pod IP.

### fn tcpSocket.withPort

```ts
withPort(port)
```

IntOrString is a type that can hold an int32 or a string.  When used in JSON or YAML marshalling and unmarshalling, it produces or consumes the inner type.  This allows you to have, for example, a JSON field that can accept a name or number.
