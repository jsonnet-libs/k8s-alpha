## Fields

### fn withNodeSelector

```ts
withNodeSelector(nodeSelector)
```

nodeSelector lists labels that must be present on nodes that support this RuntimeClass. Pods using this RuntimeClass can only be scheduled to a node matched by this selector. The RuntimeClass nodeSelector is merged with a pod's existing nodeSelector. Any conflicts will cause the pod to be rejected in admission.

### fn withNodeSelectorMixin

```ts
withNodeSelectorMixin(nodeSelector)
```

nodeSelector lists labels that must be present on nodes that support this RuntimeClass. Pods using this RuntimeClass can only be scheduled to a node matched by this selector. The RuntimeClass nodeSelector is merged with a pod's existing nodeSelector. Any conflicts will cause the pod to be rejected in admission.

**Note:** This function appends passed data to existing values

### fn withTolerations

```ts
withTolerations(tolerations)
```

tolerations are appended (excluding duplicates) to pods running with this RuntimeClass during admission, effectively unioning the set of nodes tolerated by the pod and the RuntimeClass.

### fn withTolerationsMixin

```ts
withTolerationsMixin(tolerations)
```

tolerations are appended (excluding duplicates) to pods running with this RuntimeClass during admission, effectively unioning the set of nodes tolerated by the pod and the RuntimeClass.
