## Fields

### fn withMaxUnavailable

```ts
withMaxUnavailable(maxUnavailable)
```

IntOrString is a type that can hold an int32 or a string.  When used in JSON or YAML marshalling and unmarshalling, it produces or consumes the inner type.  This allows you to have, for example, a JSON field that can accept a name or number.

### fn withMinAvailable

```ts
withMinAvailable(minAvailable)
```

IntOrString is a type that can hold an int32 or a string.  When used in JSON or YAML marshalling and unmarshalling, it produces or consumes the inner type.  This allows you to have, for example, a JSON field that can accept a name or number.

## obj selector

A label selector is a label query over a set of resources. The result of matchLabels and matchExpressions are ANDed. An empty label selector matches all objects. A null label selector matches no objects.

### fn selector.withMatchExpressions

```ts
withMatchExpressions(matchExpressions)
```

matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed.

### fn selector.withMatchExpressionsMixin

```ts
withMatchExpressionsMixin(matchExpressions)
```

matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed.

**Note:** This function appends passed data to existing values

### fn selector.withMatchLabels

```ts
withMatchLabels(matchLabels)
```

matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed.

### fn selector.withMatchLabelsMixin

```ts
withMatchLabelsMixin(matchLabels)
```

matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed.
