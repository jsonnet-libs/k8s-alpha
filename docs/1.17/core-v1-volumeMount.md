## Fields

### fn withMountPath

```ts
withMountPath(mountPath)
```

Path within the container at which the volume should be mounted.  Must not contain ':'.

### fn withMountPropagation

```ts
withMountPropagation(mountPropagation)
```

mountPropagation determines how mounts are propagated from the host to container and the other way around. When not set, MountPropagationNone is used. This field is beta in 1.10.

### fn withName

```ts
withName(name)
```

This must match the Name of a Volume.

### fn withReadOnly

```ts
withReadOnly(readOnly)
```

Mounted read-only if true, read-write otherwise (false or unspecified). Defaults to false.

### fn withSubPath

```ts
withSubPath(subPath)
```

Path within the volume from which the container's volume should be mounted. Defaults to '' (volume's root).

### fn withSubPathExpr

```ts
withSubPathExpr(subPathExpr)
```

Expanded path within the volume from which the container's volume should be mounted. Behaves similarly to SubPath but environment variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment. Defaults to '' (volume's root). SubPathExpr and SubPath are mutually exclusive.
