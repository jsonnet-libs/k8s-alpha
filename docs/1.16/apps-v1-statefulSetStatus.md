## Fields

### fn withCollisionCount

```ts
withCollisionCount(collisionCount)
```

collisionCount is the count of hash collisions for the StatefulSet. The StatefulSet controller uses this field as a collision avoidance mechanism when it needs to create the name for the newest ControllerRevision.

### fn withConditions

```ts
withConditions(conditions)
```

Represents the latest available observations of a statefulset's current state.

### fn withConditionsMixin

```ts
withConditionsMixin(conditions)
```

Represents the latest available observations of a statefulset's current state.

**Note:** This function appends passed data to existing values

### fn withCurrentReplicas

```ts
withCurrentReplicas(currentReplicas)
```

currentReplicas is the number of Pods created by the StatefulSet controller from the StatefulSet version indicated by currentRevision.

### fn withCurrentRevision

```ts
withCurrentRevision(currentRevision)
```

currentRevision, if not empty, indicates the version of the StatefulSet used to generate Pods in the sequence [0,currentReplicas).

### fn withObservedGeneration

```ts
withObservedGeneration(observedGeneration)
```

observedGeneration is the most recent generation observed for this StatefulSet. It corresponds to the StatefulSet's generation, which is updated on mutation by the API Server.

### fn withReadyReplicas

```ts
withReadyReplicas(readyReplicas)
```

readyReplicas is the number of Pods created by the StatefulSet controller that have a Ready Condition.

### fn withReplicas

```ts
withReplicas(replicas)
```

replicas is the number of Pods created by the StatefulSet controller.

### fn withUpdateRevision

```ts
withUpdateRevision(updateRevision)
```

updateRevision, if not empty, indicates the version of the StatefulSet used to generate Pods in the sequence [replicas-updatedReplicas,replicas)

### fn withUpdatedReplicas

```ts
withUpdatedReplicas(updatedReplicas)
```

updatedReplicas is the number of Pods created by the StatefulSet controller from the StatefulSet version indicated by updateRevision.
