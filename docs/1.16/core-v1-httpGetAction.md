## Fields

### fn withHost

```ts

```

Host name to connect to, defaults to the pod IP. You probably want to set "Host" in httpHeaders instead.

### fn withHttpHeaders

```ts
withHttpHeaders(httpHeaders)
```

Custom headers to set in the request. HTTP allows repeated headers.

### fn withHttpHeadersMixin

```ts
withHttpHeadersMixin(httpHeaders)
```

Custom headers to set in the request. HTTP allows repeated headers.

**Note:** This function appends passed data to existing values

### fn withPath

```ts
withPath(path)
```

Path to access on the HTTP server.

### fn withPort

```ts
withPort(port)
```

IntOrString is a type that can hold an int32 or a string.  When used in JSON or YAML marshalling and unmarshalling, it produces or consumes the inner type.  This allows you to have, for example, a JSON field that can accept a name or number.

### fn withScheme

```ts
withScheme(scheme)
```

Scheme to use for connecting to the host. Defaults to HTTP.
