## Fields

### fn withAudiences

```ts
withAudiences(audiences)
```

Audiences are the intendend audiences of the token. A recipient of a token must identitfy themself with an identifier in the list of audiences of the token, and otherwise should reject the token. A token issued for multiple audiences may be used to authenticate against any of the audiences listed but implies a high degree of trust between the target audiences.

### fn withAudiencesMixin

```ts
withAudiencesMixin(audiences)
```

Audiences are the intendend audiences of the token. A recipient of a token must identitfy themself with an identifier in the list of audiences of the token, and otherwise should reject the token. A token issued for multiple audiences may be used to authenticate against any of the audiences listed but implies a high degree of trust between the target audiences.

**Note:** This function appends passed data to existing values

### fn withExpirationSeconds

```ts
withExpirationSeconds(expirationSeconds)
```

ExpirationSeconds is the requested duration of validity of the request. The token issuer may return a token with a different validity duration so a client needs to check the 'expiration' field in a response.

## obj boundObjectRef

BoundObjectReference is a reference to an object that a token is bound to.

### fn boundObjectRef.withKind

```ts
withKind(kind)
```

Kind of the referent. Valid kinds are 'Pod' and 'Secret'.

### fn boundObjectRef.withName

```ts
withName(name)
```

Name of the referent.

### fn boundObjectRef.withUid

```ts
withUid(uid)
```

UID of the referent.
