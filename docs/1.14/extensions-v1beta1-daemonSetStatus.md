## Fields

### fn withCollisionCount

```ts
withCollisionCount(collisionCount)
```

Count of hash collisions for the DaemonSet. The DaemonSet controller uses this field as a collision avoidance mechanism when it needs to create the name for the newest ControllerRevision.

### fn withConditions

```ts
withConditions(conditions)
```

Represents the latest available observations of a DaemonSet's current state.

### fn withConditionsMixin

```ts
withConditionsMixin(conditions)
```

Represents the latest available observations of a DaemonSet's current state.

**Note:** This function appends passed data to existing values

### fn withCurrentNumberScheduled

```ts
withCurrentNumberScheduled(currentNumberScheduled)
```

The number of nodes that are running at least 1 daemon pod and are supposed to run the daemon pod. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/

### fn withDesiredNumberScheduled

```ts
withDesiredNumberScheduled(desiredNumberScheduled)
```

The total number of nodes that should be running the daemon pod (including nodes correctly running the daemon pod). More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/

### fn withNumberAvailable

```ts
withNumberAvailable(numberAvailable)
```

The number of nodes that should be running the daemon pod and have one or more of the daemon pod running and available (ready for at least spec.minReadySeconds)

### fn withNumberMisscheduled

```ts
withNumberMisscheduled(numberMisscheduled)
```

The number of nodes that are running the daemon pod, but are not supposed to run the daemon pod. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/

### fn withNumberReady

```ts
withNumberReady(numberReady)
```

The number of nodes that should be running the daemon pod and have one or more of the daemon pod running and ready.

### fn withNumberUnavailable

```ts
withNumberUnavailable(numberUnavailable)
```

The number of nodes that should be running the daemon pod and have none of the daemon pod running and available (ready for at least spec.minReadySeconds)

### fn withObservedGeneration

```ts
withObservedGeneration(observedGeneration)
```

The most recent generation observed by the daemon set controller.

### fn withUpdatedNumberScheduled

```ts
withUpdatedNumberScheduled(updatedNumberScheduled)
```

The total number of nodes that are running updated daemon pod
