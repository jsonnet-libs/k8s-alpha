## Fields

### fn withCurrentCPUUtilizationPercentage

```ts
withCurrentCPUUtilizationPercentage(currentCPUUtilizationPercentage)
```

current average CPU utilization over all pods, represented as a percentage of requested CPU, e.g. 70 means that an average pod is using now 70% of its requested CPU.

### fn withCurrentReplicas

```ts
withCurrentReplicas(currentReplicas)
```

current number of replicas of pods managed by this autoscaler.

### fn withDesiredReplicas

```ts
withDesiredReplicas(desiredReplicas)
```

desired number of replicas of pods managed by this autoscaler.

### fn withLastScaleTime

```ts
withLastScaleTime(lastScaleTime)
```

Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.

### fn withObservedGeneration

```ts
withObservedGeneration(observedGeneration)
```

most recent generation observed by this autoscaler.
