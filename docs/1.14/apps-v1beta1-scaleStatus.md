## Fields

### fn withReplicas

```ts
withReplicas(replicas)
```

actual number of observed instances of the scaled object.

### fn withSelector

```ts
withSelector(selector)
```

label query over pods that should match the replicas count. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels#label-selectors

### fn withSelectorMixin

```ts
withSelectorMixin(selector)
```

label query over pods that should match the replicas count. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels#label-selectors

**Note:** This function appends passed data to existing values

### fn withTargetSelector

```ts
withTargetSelector(targetSelector)
```

label selector for pods that should match the replicas count. This is a serializated version of both map-based and more expressive set-based selectors. This is done to avoid introspection in the clients. The string will be in the same format as the query-param syntax. If the target type only supports map-based selectors, both this field and map-based selector field are populated.
