## Fields

### fn withDriver

```ts
withDriver(driver)
```

Driver is the name of the CSI driver that handles this volume. Consult with your admin for the correct name as registered in the cluster.

### fn withFsType

```ts
withFsType(fsType)
```

Filesystem type to mount. Ex. "ext4", "xfs", "ntfs". If not provided, the empty value is passed to the associated CSI driver which will determine the default filesystem to apply.

### fn withReadOnly

```ts
withReadOnly(readOnly)
```

Specifies a read-only configuration for the volume. Defaults to false (read/write).

### fn withVolumeAttributes

```ts
withVolumeAttributes(volumeAttributes)
```

VolumeAttributes stores driver-specific properties that are passed to the CSI driver. Consult your driver's documentation for supported values.

### fn withVolumeAttributesMixin

```ts
withVolumeAttributesMixin(volumeAttributes)
```

VolumeAttributes stores driver-specific properties that are passed to the CSI driver. Consult your driver's documentation for supported values.

**Note:** This function appends passed data to existing values

## obj nodePublishSecretRef

LocalObjectReference contains enough information to let you locate the referenced object inside the same namespace.

### fn nodePublishSecretRef.withName

```ts
withName(name)
```

Name of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names
