## Fields

## obj resource

TypedLocalObjectReference contains enough information to let you locate the typed referenced object inside the same namespace.

### fn resource.withApiGroup

```ts
withApiGroup(apiGroup)
```

APIGroup is the group for the resource being referenced. If APIGroup is not specified, the specified Kind must be in the core API group. For any other third-party types, APIGroup is required.

### fn resource.withKind

```ts
withKind(kind)
```

Kind is the type of resource being referenced

### fn resource.withName

```ts
withName(name)
```

Name is the name of resource being referenced

## obj service

IngressServiceBackend references a Kubernetes Service as a Backend.

### fn service.withName

```ts
withName(name)
```

Name is the referenced service. The service must exist in the same namespace as the Ingress object.

## obj service.port

ServiceBackendPort is the service port being referenced.

### fn service.port.withName

```ts
withName(name)
```

Name is the name of the port on the Service. This is a mutually exclusive setting with "Number".

### fn service.port.withNumber

```ts
withNumber(number)
```

Number is the numerical port number (e.g. 80) on the Service. This is a mutually exclusive setting with "Name".
