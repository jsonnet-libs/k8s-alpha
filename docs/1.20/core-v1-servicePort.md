# package servicePort

ServicePort contains information on service's port.

## Fields

### fn new

```ts
new(port, targetPort)
```

new returns a new `servicePort`

### fn newNamed

```ts
newNamed(name, port, targetPort)
```

newNamed works like `new`, but also sets the `name`

### fn withAppProtocol

```ts
withAppProtocol(appProtocol)
```

The application protocol for this port. This field follows standard Kubernetes label syntax. Un-prefixed names are reserved for IANA standard service names (as per RFC-6335 and http://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names). Non-standard protocols should use prefixed names such as mycompany.com/my-custom-protocol. This is a beta field that is guarded by the ServiceAppProtocol feature gate and enabled by default.

### fn withName

```ts
withName(name)
```

The name of this port within the service. This must be a DNS_LABEL. All ports within a ServiceSpec must have unique names. When considering the endpoints for a Service, this must match the 'name' field in the EndpointPort. Optional if only one ServicePort is defined on this service.

### fn withNodePort

```ts
withNodePort(nodePort)
```

The port on each node on which this service is exposed when type is NodePort or LoadBalancer.  Usually assigned by the system. If a value is specified, in-range, and not in use it will be used, otherwise the operation will fail.  If not specified, a port will be allocated if this Service requires one.  If this field is specified when creating a Service which does not need it, creation will fail. This field will be wiped when updating a Service to no longer need it (e.g. changing type from NodePort to ClusterIP). More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#type-nodeport

### fn withPort

```ts
withPort(port)
```

The port that will be exposed by this service.

### fn withProtocol

```ts
withProtocol(protocol)
```

The IP protocol for this port. Supports "TCP", "UDP", and "SCTP". Default is TCP.

### fn withTargetPort

```ts
withTargetPort(targetPort)
```

IntOrString is a type that can hold an int32 or a string.  When used in JSON or YAML marshalling and unmarshalling, it produces or consumes the inner type.  This allows you to have, for example, a JSON field that can accept a name or number.
