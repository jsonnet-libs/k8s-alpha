The admission controller populates this field from PriorityClassName. The higher the value, the higher the priority.

### fn withPriorityClassName

```ts
withPriorityClassName(priorityClassName)
```

If specified, indicates the pod's priority. 'system-node-critical' and 'system-cluster-critical' are two special keywords which indicate the highest priorities with the former being the highest priority.

### fn withRuntimeClassName

```ts
withRuntimeClassName(runtimeClassName)
```

RuntimeClassName refers to a RuntimeClass object in the node.k8s.io group, which should be used to run this pod.  If no RuntimeClass resource matches the named class, the pod will not be run. If unset or empty, the "legacy" RuntimeClass will be used, which is an implicit class with an empty definition that uses the default runtime handler. More info: https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/runtime-class.md This is a beta feature as of Kubernetes v1.14.

### fn withSchedulerName

```ts
withSchedulerName(schedulerName)

In Linux containers, this means setting the FQDN in the hostname field of the kernel (the nodename field of struct utsname). In Windows containers, this means setting the registry value of hostname for the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters to FQDN. If a pod does not have FQDN, this has no effect. Default to false.

### fn withShareProcessNamespace

```ts
withShareProcessNamespace(shareProcessNamespace)
```

Share a single process namespace between all of the containers in a pod. When this is set containers will be able to view and signal processes from other containers in the same pod, and the first process in each container will not be assigned PID 1. HostPID and ShareProcessNamespace cannot both be set. Optional: Default to false.

### fn withSubdomain

```ts
withSubdomain(subdomain)
```

If specified, the fully qualified Pod hostname will be "<hostname>.<subdomain>.<pod namespace>.svc.<cluster domain>". If not specified, the pod will not have a domainname at all.

### fn withTerminationGracePeriodSeconds

```ts
withTerminationGracePeriodSeconds(terminationGracePeriodSeconds)
```

Optional duration in seconds the pod needs to terminate gracefully. May be decreased in delete request. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down). If this value is nil, the default grace period will be used instead. The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal. Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process. Defaults to 30 seconds.

## obj securityContext

PodSecurityContext holds pod-level security attributes and common container settings. Some fields are also present in container.securityContext.  Field values of container.securityContext take precedence over field values of PodSecurityContext.

### fn securityContext.withFsGroup

```ts
withFsGroup(fsGroup)
```

A special supplemental group that applies to all containers in a pod. Some volume types allow the Kubelet to change the ownership of that volume to be owned by the pod:

1. The owning GID will be the FSGroup 2. The setgid bit is set (new files created in the volume will be owned by FSGroup) 3. The permission bits are OR'd with rw-rw----

If unset, the Kubelet will not modify the ownership and permissions of any volume.

### fn securityContext.withFsGroupChangePolicy

```ts
withFsGroupChangePolicy(fsGroupChangePolicy)
```

fsGroupChangePolicy defines behavior of changing ownership and permission of the volume before being exposed inside Pod. This field will only apply to volume types which support fsGroup based ownership(and permissions). It will have no effect on ephemeral volume types such as: secret, configmaps and emptydir. Valid values are "OnRootMismatch" and "Always". If not specified, "Always" is used.

### fn securityContext.withRunAsGroup

```ts
withRunAsGroup(runAsGroup)
```

The GID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Uses runtime default if unset. May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence for that container.

### fn securityContext.withRunAsNonRoot

```ts
withRunAsNonRoot(runAsNonRoot)
```

Indicates that the container must run as a non-root user. If true, the Kubelet will validate the image at runtime to ensure that it does not run as UID 0 (root) and fail to start the container if it does. If unset or false, no such validation will be performed. May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence.

### fn securityContext.withRunAsUser

```ts
withRunAsUser(runAsUser)
```

The UID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Defaults to user specified in image metadata if unspecified. May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence for that container.

### fn securityContext.withSupplementalGroups

```ts
withSupplementalGroups(supplementalGroups)
```

A list of groups applied to the first process run in each container, in addition to the container's primary GID.  If unspecified, no groups will be added to any container.

### fn securityContext.withSupplementalGroupsMixin

```ts
withSupplementalGroupsMixin(supplementalGroups)
```

A list of groups applied to the first process run in each container, in addition to the container's primary GID.  If unspecified, no groups will be added to any container.

**Note:** This function appends passed data to existing values

### fn securityContext.withSysctls

```ts
withSysctls(sysctls)
```

Sysctls hold a list of namespaced sysctls used for the pod. Pods with unsupported sysctls (by the container runtime) might fail to launch.

### fn securityContext.withSysctlsMixin

```ts
withSysctlsMixin(sysctls)
```

Sysctls hold a list of namespaced sysctls used for the pod. Pods with unsupported sysctls (by the container runtime) might fail to launch.

**Note:** This function appends passed data to existing values

## obj securityContext.seLinuxOptions

SELinuxOptions are the labels to be applied to the container

### fn securityContext.seLinuxOptions.withLevel

```ts
withLevel(level)
```

Level is SELinux level label that applies to the container.

### fn securityContext.seLinuxOptions.withRole

```ts
withRole(role)
```

Role is a SELinux role label that applies to the container.

### fn securityContext.seLinuxOptions.withType

```ts
withType(type)
```

Type is a SELinux type label that applies to the container.

### fn securityContext.seLinuxOptions.withUser

```ts
withUser(user)
```

User is a SELinux user label that applies to the container.

## obj securityContext.seccompProfile



### fn securityContext.seccompProfile.withLocalhostProfile

```ts
withLocalhostProfile(localhostProfile)
```

localhostProfile indicates a profile defined in a file on the node should be used. The profile must be preconfigured on the node to work. Must be a descending path, relative to the kubelet's configured seccomp profile location. Must only be set if type is 'Localhost'.

### fn securityContext.seccompProfile.withType

```ts
withType(type)
```

type indicates which kind of seccomp profile will be applied. Valid options are:

Localhost - a profile defined in a file on the node should be used. RuntimeDefault - the container runtime default profile should be used. Unconfined - no profile should be applied.

## obj securityContext.windowsOptions

WindowsSecurityContextOptions contain Windows-specific options and credentials.

### fn securityContext.windowsOptions.withGmsaCredentialSpec

```ts
withGmsaCredentialSpec(gmsaCredentialSpec)
```

GMSACredentialSpec is where the GMSA admission webhook (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/windows-gmsa) inlines the contents of the GMSA credential spec named by the GMSACredentialSpecName field.

### fn securityContext.windowsOptions.withGmsaCredentialSpecName

```ts
withGmsaCredentialSpecName(gmsaCredentialSpecName)
```

GMSACredentialSpecName is the name of the GMSA credential spec to use.

### fn securityContext.windowsOptions.withRunAsUserName

```ts
withRunAsUserName(runAsUserName)
```

The UserName in Windows to run the entrypoint of the container process. Defaults to the user specified in image metadata if unspecified. May also be set in PodSecurityContext. If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence.
