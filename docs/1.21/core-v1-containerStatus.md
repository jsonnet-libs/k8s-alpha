## Fields

### fn withContainerID

```ts
withContainerID(containerID)
```

Container's ID in the format 'docker://<container_id>'.

### fn withImage

```ts
withImage(image)
```

The image the container is running. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images

### fn withImageID

```ts
