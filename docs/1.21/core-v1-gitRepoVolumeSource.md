# package gitRepoVolumeSource

Represents a volume that is populated with the contents of a git repository. Git repo volumes do not support ownership management. Git repo volumes support SELinux relabeling.

DEPRECATED: GitRepo is deprecated. To provision a container with a git repo, mount an EmptyDir into an InitContainer that clones the repo using git, then mount the EmptyDir into the Pod's container.
