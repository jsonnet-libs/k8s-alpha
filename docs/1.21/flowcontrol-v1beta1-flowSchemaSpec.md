## Fields

### fn withMatchingPrecedence

```ts
withMatchingPrecedence(matchingPrecedence)
```

`matchingPrecedence` is used to choose among the FlowSchemas that match a given request. The chosen FlowSchema is among those with the numerically lowest (which we take to be logically highest) MatchingPrecedence.  Each MatchingPrecedence value must be ranged in [1,10000]. Note that if the precedence is not specified, it will be set to 1000 as default.

### fn withRules

```ts
withRules(rules)
```

`rules` describes which requests will match this flow schema. This FlowSchema matches a request if and only if at least one member of rules matches the request. if it is an empty slice, there will be no requests matching the FlowSchema.

### fn withRulesMixin

```ts
withRulesMixin(rules)
```

`rules` describes which requests will match this flow schema. This FlowSchema matches a request if and only if at least one member of rules matches the request. if it is an empty slice, there will be no requests matching the FlowSchema.

**Note:** This function appends passed data to existing values

## obj distinguisherMethod

FlowDistinguisherMethod specifies the method of a flow distinguisher.

### fn distinguisherMethod.withType

```ts
withType(type)
```

`type` is the type of flow distinguisher method The supported types are "ByUser" and "ByNamespace". Required.

## obj priorityLevelConfiguration

PriorityLevelConfigurationReference contains information that points to the "request-priority" being used.

### fn priorityLevelConfiguration.withName

```ts
withName(name)
```

`name` is the name of the priority level configuration being referenced Required.
