withReason(reason)
```

This should be a short, machine understandable string that gives the reason for the transition into the object's current status.

### fn withReportingComponent

### fn involvedObject.withFieldPath

```ts
withFieldPath(fieldPath)
```

If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2]. For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of an object.

### fn involvedObject.withKind

Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations

### fn metadata.withAnnotationsMixin

```ts
withAnnotationsMixin(annotations)
```

### fn metadata.withFinalizers

```ts
withFinalizers(finalizers)
```

Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed.

### fn metadata.withFinalizersMixin

```ts
withFinalizersMixin(finalizers)
```

Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed.

### fn metadata.withGenerateName

```ts
withGenerateName(generateName)
```

GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.

If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).

Applied only if Name is not specified. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#idempotency

### fn metadata.withLabelsMixin

```ts
withLabelsMixin(labels)
```

Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers and services. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels

### fn metadata.withManagedFields

```ts
withManagedFields(managedFields)
```

ManagedFields maps workflow-id and version to the set of fields that are managed by that workflow. This is mostly for internal housekeeping, and users typically shouldn't need to set or understand this field. A workflow can be the user's name, a controller's name, or the name of a specific apply path like 'ci-cd'. The set of fields is always in the version that the workflow used when modifying the object.

This field is alpha and can be changed or removed without notice.

### fn metadata.withManagedFieldsMixin

```ts
withManagedFieldsMixin(managedFields)
```

ManagedFields maps workflow-id and version to the set of fields that are managed by that workflow. This is mostly for internal housekeeping, and users typically shouldn't need to set or understand this field. A workflow can be the user's name, a controller's name, or the name of a specific apply path like 'ci-cd'. The set of fields is always in the version that the workflow used when modifying the object.

This field is alpha and can be changed or removed without notice.

**Note:** This function appends passed data to existing values

### fn metadata.withNamespace

```ts
withNamespace(namespace)
```

Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty.

Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces

### fn metadata.withOwnerReferences

```ts
withOwnerReferences(ownerReferences)
```

List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing controller.

### fn metadata.withOwnerReferencesMixin

```ts
withOwnerReferencesMixin(ownerReferences)
```

List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing controller.

**Note:** This function appends passed data to existing values

withUid(uid)
```

UID is the unique in time and space value for this object. It is typically generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not allowed to change on PUT operations.

Populated by the system. Read-only. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids

## obj metadata.initializers

Initializers tracks the progress of initialization.

### fn metadata.initializers.withPending

```ts
withPending(pending)

### fn metadata.initializers.withPendingMixin

```ts
withPendingMixin(pending)
```

Pending is a list of initializers that must execute in order before this object is visible. When the last pending initializer is removed, and no failing result is set, the initializers struct will be set to nil and the object is considered as initialized and visible to all clients.
