# package endpointSubset

EndpointSubset is a group of addresses with a common set of ports. The expanded set of endpoints is the Cartesian product of Addresses x Ports. For example, given:
  {
    Addresses: [{"ip": "10.10.1.1"}, {"ip": "10.10.2.2"}],
    Ports:     [{"name": "a", "port": 8675}, {"name": "b", "port": 309}]
  }
The resulting set of endpoints can be viewed as:
    a: [ 10.10.1.1:8675, 10.10.2.2:8675 ],
    b: [ 10.10.1.1:309, 10.10.2.2:309 ]

## Fields

### fn withAddresses

```ts
withAddresses(addresses)
```

IP addresses which offer the related ports that are marked as ready. These endpoints should be considered safe for load balancers and clients to utilize.

### fn withAddressesMixin

```ts
withAddressesMixin(addresses)
```

IP addresses which offer the related ports that are marked as ready. These endpoints should be considered safe for load balancers and clients to utilize.

**Note:** This function appends passed data to existing values

### fn withNotReadyAddresses

```ts
withNotReadyAddresses(notReadyAddresses)
```

IP addresses which offer the related ports but are not currently marked as ready because they have not yet finished starting, have recently failed a readiness check, or have recently failed a liveness check.

### fn withNotReadyAddressesMixin

```ts
withNotReadyAddressesMixin(notReadyAddresses)
```

IP addresses which offer the related ports but are not currently marked as ready because they have not yet finished starting, have recently failed a readiness check, or have recently failed a liveness check.

**Note:** This function appends passed data to existing values

### fn withPorts

```ts
withPorts(ports)
```

Port numbers available on the related IP addresses.

### fn withPortsMixin

```ts
withPortsMixin(ports)
```

Port numbers available on the related IP addresses.
