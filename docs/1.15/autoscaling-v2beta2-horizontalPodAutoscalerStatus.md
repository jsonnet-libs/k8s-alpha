## Fields

### fn withConditions

```ts
withConditions(conditions)
```

conditions is the set of conditions required for this autoscaler to scale its target, and indicates whether or not those conditions are met.

### fn withConditionsMixin

```ts
withConditionsMixin(conditions)
```

conditions is the set of conditions required for this autoscaler to scale its target, and indicates whether or not those conditions are met.

**Note:** This function appends passed data to existing values

### fn withCurrentMetrics

```ts
withCurrentMetrics(currentMetrics)
```

currentMetrics is the last read state of the metrics used by this autoscaler.

### fn withCurrentMetricsMixin

```ts
withCurrentMetricsMixin(currentMetrics)
```

currentMetrics is the last read state of the metrics used by this autoscaler.

**Note:** This function appends passed data to existing values

### fn withCurrentReplicas

```ts
withCurrentReplicas(currentReplicas)
```

currentReplicas is current number of replicas of pods managed by this autoscaler, as last seen by the autoscaler.

### fn withDesiredReplicas

```ts
withDesiredReplicas(desiredReplicas)
```

desiredReplicas is the desired number of replicas of pods managed by this autoscaler, as last calculated by the autoscaler.

### fn withLastScaleTime

```ts
withLastScaleTime(lastScaleTime)
```

Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.

### fn withObservedGeneration

```ts
withObservedGeneration(observedGeneration)
```

observedGeneration is the most recent generation observed by this autoscaler.
