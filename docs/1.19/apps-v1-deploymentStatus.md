## Fields

### fn withAvailableReplicas

```ts
withAvailableReplicas(availableReplicas)
```

Total number of available pods (ready for at least minReadySeconds) targeted by this deployment.

### fn withCollisionCount

```ts
withCollisionCount(collisionCount)
```

Count of hash collisions for the Deployment. The Deployment controller uses this field as a collision avoidance mechanism when it needs to create the name for the newest ReplicaSet.

### fn withConditions

```ts
withConditions(conditions)
```

Represents the latest available observations of a deployment's current state.

### fn withConditionsMixin

```ts
withConditionsMixin(conditions)
```

Represents the latest available observations of a deployment's current state.

**Note:** This function appends passed data to existing values

### fn withObservedGeneration

```ts
withObservedGeneration(observedGeneration)
```

The generation observed by the deployment controller.

### fn withReadyReplicas

```ts
withReadyReplicas(readyReplicas)
```

Total number of ready pods targeted by this deployment.

### fn withReplicas

```ts
withReplicas(replicas)
```

Total number of non-terminated pods targeted by this deployment (their labels match the selector).

### fn withUnavailableReplicas

```ts
withUnavailableReplicas(unavailableReplicas)
```

Total number of unavailable pods targeted by this deployment. This is the total number of pods that are still required for the deployment to have 100% available capacity. They may either be pods that are running but not yet available or pods that still have not been created.

### fn withUpdatedReplicas

```ts
withUpdatedReplicas(updatedReplicas)
```

Total number of non-terminated pods targeted by this deployment that have the desired template spec.
